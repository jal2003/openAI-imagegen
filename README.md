# openAI-imagegen

Experimenting with OPEN AI platform to build an application that generates images based on text 


My free trial for the OPEN AI API key expired so the app does not function as it is supposed to but once I buy the subscription for the API key, it will work :) 

(someone hire me so I can pay for the API subscriptions please :) ) 








# Usage
Rename the example.env file to .env.

Generate an API KEY at OpenAI and add it to the .env file.

Install the dependencies

npm install
Run server

npm start
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

The endpoint is at POST http://localhost:5000/openai/generateimage.
